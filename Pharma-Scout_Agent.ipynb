for medicines due to lack of price transparency across 100+ pharmacies.\n","\n","**Solution**: An intelligent multi-agent system powered by Google ADK that:\n","- 📸 Scans prescriptions using computer vision\n","- 🔍 Searches 10+ platforms in parallel\n","- 📊 Analyzes prices in real-time\n","- 💰 Recommends best deals (avg 30% savings)\n","- 🛒 Order directly from the best vendor\n","\n","**Impact**:

assistant:**\n","- You show it your prescription → It reads all the medicine names\n","- It checks prices at different stores (like comparing prices at 5 different shops)\n","- It tells you where to buy for the lowest price\n","- You click a button and it takes you there to order!\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🚀 Setting Up the Agent\n","\n","This cell installs all the \"tools\" our agent needs to work
